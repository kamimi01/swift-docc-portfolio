    @Intro(title: "Welcome to Mika's Portfolio! 🌞 with Swift-DocC!") {
        On this website, I mainly introduce personal development projects. 
        
        The most interesting point is that this website is made with [Swift-DocC](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-docc). (GitHub is [here](https://github.com/kamimi01/swift-docc-portfolio))
        
        Enjoy your reading!

        Had the great opportunity to speak at iOSDC Japan 2023, the top conference for iOS app development in Japan. And gave a presentation on iOS app automated build at an external tech conference held at Yappli, as well as presentations within the company.
