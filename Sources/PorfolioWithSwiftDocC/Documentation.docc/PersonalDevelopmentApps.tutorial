    @Intro(title: "Personal Developmant Apps") {
        I enjoy developing personal development apps, primarily for iOS üçé (you can find a list of the iOS apps I have released here). I am keenly interested in iOS app development and am currently working actively with SwiftUI. Additionally, I am exploring cross-platform development and experimenting with replacing previously released apps using Flutter. I also have experience developing Google Apps Script (GAS), and Slack apps, and open-source software (OSS) libraries.
